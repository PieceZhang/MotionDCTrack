**Accepted by ICRA 2025**

Dual-camera tracker with cross-camera mutual template strategy (CMT) and Mamba-based motion-guided prediction head (MMH). 

Designed for tracking under challenging environments with noisy background and severe disturbance.

**This repository is now under construction. Code and dataset will be released soon.**
